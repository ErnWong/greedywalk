# The Greedy Walk Project

This is my submission for the first ENGGEN 131 project using MATLAB in 2017 Semester 2.

## Project Outline

Note: To respect the original creators of the original project document, the original documents have been excluded from this public repository.

In summary, the project requires us to write 8 MATLAB functions with prescribed specifications. The functionality of each are described in the comments in the beginning of each file.

The ultimate goal is, given a 2D array representing the elevation data of a terrain, to compute the best/sub-best path to travel from the west edge to the east edge such that the accumulative absolute elevation change is minimised.

Next up are some fancy images to stare at if you're bored.

*See if you can spot the faint yellow path on the first image, and the corresponding faint red path on the second image*
